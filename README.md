# semacrawl

The crawler just prints the sites visited and the crawl time.

The database is in memory so it is limited in size. However, access time is much faster than using a cloud db.

## Requirements

The `requests` library is great for any web crawling mechanisms.

To get started, run: `pip3 install requests`

`threading` was used to create a timer for the threads.
